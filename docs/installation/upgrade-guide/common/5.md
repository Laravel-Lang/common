## Updating Dependencies

You should update the following dependency in your application's `composer.json` file:

* `laravel-lang/common` to `^5.0`

Rename the configuration file:

```bash
mv config/lang-publisher.php config/localization.php
```

Run the update dependency console command:

```bash
composer update
```

## Upgrade publisher

If you use access to locales or a locale helper in production, then also follow the necessary steps described in
the [publisher upgrade section](../publisher/15.md#new-constants-namespace).

## Using in production

If you use access to facades and locales in production, then you also need to perform the following steps:

```bash
composer require laravel-lang/common --dev --quiet
composer require laravel-lang/locales
```
